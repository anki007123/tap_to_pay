# Copilot / AI agent instructions for tap_to_pay

Purpose
- Provide concise, actionable guidance so an AI coding agent becomes productive immediately in this workspace.

Big picture (what you'll see)
- Repo layout: top-level folders `backend/`, `frontend-admin/`, `frontend-merchant/` (currently empty skeletons). Check these directories first for service code.
- Intent: separate backend service from two frontends (admin vs merchant). Keep logic and infra per service directory.

What to look for first (how to detect tech & workflows)
- If `package.json` exists in a service: treat it as a Node.js frontend or service. Common commands: `npm ci` (or `npm install`) and `npm run dev` or `npm start`. Look for `scripts` in that `package.json`.
- If `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` exists: treat as Python service; use `python -m venv .venv && .venv\\Scripts\\pip install -r requirements.txt` on Windows.
- If a `Dockerfile` exists in a directory: prefer building and testing locally with Docker during infra changes: `docker build -t tap_to_pay-<service> .`.

Patterns & conventions used in this repo
- Service separation: each top-level folder represents an independent service or UI; keep service-specific dependencies and scripts inside the service folder.
- Documentation: `README.md` at repo root is the canonical place for repo overview. If you add service-specific run steps, add `README.md` inside that service folder.

How to make safe code changes
- When adding code to a service, follow the local package manager flow you discover (see "What to look for").
- Add or update the service `README.md` with exact commands you used to run and test locally.

Examples to use when you detect project types
- Node frontend example (when `frontend-*/package.json` exists):

  - Install and run: `npm ci` then `npm run dev`
  - Run tests (if present): `npm test`

- Python backend example (when `backend/requirements.txt` exists):

  - Create venv: `python -m venv .venv`
  - Install: `.venv\\Scripts\\pip install -r requirements.txt`

When you can't find tooling files
- If a service folder is empty or missing build metadata, open a draft PR that adds a minimal `README.md` describing intended language/stack and include a short checklist (install/run/test). Ask the maintainers for preferred tooling if unclear.

PR & commit guidance for agents
- Keep changes small and focused to one service when possible.
- Update the service `README.md` and root `README.md` when adding or changing developer workflows.

Where to look for more context
- Inspect `backend/`, `frontend-admin/`, `frontend-merchant/` when populated.
- Check for `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, and service-level `README.md` files.

If something is ambiguous
- Create a short issue or PR description listing assumptions (runtime, build commands) and include the minimal steps you used to validate locally.

If you find existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or AGENT docs, merge preserving any explicit scripts or commands they list.

Feedback
- If parts of this guidance are unclear or you want more specific run commands for detected stacks, ask maintainers and update this file.
